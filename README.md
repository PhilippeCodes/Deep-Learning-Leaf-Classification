# Deep-Learning-Leaf-Classification

In this project we create a variety of deep learning models in an effort to predict the species of different leaves.
In our Keras models we use both (pre-extracted) structured and unstructured image data in order to build a good classifier.
The data can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification/overview
